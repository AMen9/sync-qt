3a) Using QtCreator

Open owncloud_sync.pro with QtCreator. Then navigate to the Projects tab.
Select Build Settings. Expand the qmake section (under build steps). If you want
to enable the use of KWallet add "DEFINES += OCS_USE_KWALLET" under additional
arguments (keep the quotes).


Then build and run :)
